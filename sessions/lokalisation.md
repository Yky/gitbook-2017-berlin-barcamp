# Lokalise

[The presentation about our workflow and tools that we use.](Lokalise.pdf)

## Questions
1. **Question:** Does Lokalise support stings on demand modification?

   **Answer:** Lokalise has own SDK to be shipped with that provides on demand localisations serving. 
   It is included in paid version. However, we don't use since it is not our use case. 
   So I don't have much opinion/details about it.
